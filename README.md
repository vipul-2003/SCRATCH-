This  is the code created by me for the <font color ='red'> coursera </font > course
on 

 [`Code Yourself! An Introduction to Programming`](https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-programming?)




In this program , you will came to know the basics and how things were done in programming.
Its quiet similar with real time thinking , and I'm sure that you will do that as it is simple and easy to learn and mentors have explained it in very friendly manner.
The best thing is that they do something and then explain it by showing its example which is more accomplished
